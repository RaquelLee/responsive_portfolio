# Responsive Personal Portfolio with Bootstrap

For this project, I made a personal portfolio page 
utiizing the Bootstrap grid with rows and columns.

One of my objecties was to match the layout of 
an example bootstrap website. I gained a deep understanding
of bootstap components and utilities by reading all documentation to achieve this goal. 

I look forward to continuing to updating this site as my 
portfolio and skills grow!
